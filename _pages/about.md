As a PhD student in Mathematical Finance at Imperial College London, I am passionate about applying stochastic optimization and machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in finance. I am honoured to receive the Roth Scholarship, which recognizes the best academic performance and research potential in mathematics.

I have a strong background in stochastic calculus and statistics, which I acquired from my undergraduate and master's studies at Shandong University and LSE, respectively. I graduated with outstanding results and awards, such as the Rajendra Bhansali Prize and the Outstanding Graduate Honour. I also have proficient skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and Python, which I developed through various projects and coursework. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of mathematical finance and to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges.
