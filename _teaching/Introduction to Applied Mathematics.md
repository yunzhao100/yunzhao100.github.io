This module aims to show students how the ideas they learn in Year 1 can be used to provide a mathematical underpinning for a range of scientific problems. The objective of the course is to describe a unified mathematical framework that embraces multiple disciplines involving engineering challenges as well as problems outside the physical sciences such as economics and statistics.
